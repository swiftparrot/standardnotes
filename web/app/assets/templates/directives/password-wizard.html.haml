                  Changing your password involves changing your encryption key, which requires your data to be re-encrypted and synced.
                  If you have many items, syncing your data can take several minutes.
                %p.sk-p.sk-panel-row You must keep the application window open during this process.

                  As a result of this process, the entirety of your data will be re-encrypted and synced to your account. This is a generally safe process,
                  but unforeseen factors like poor network connectivity or a sudden shutdown of your computer may cause this process to fail.
                  It's best to be on the safe side before large operations such as this one.

                  Any device on which you use Standard Notes will need to end its session. After this process completes, you will be asked to sign back in.
